# NBA Data
Project designed to store data from the NBA API.

## Setup
In order to setup the application, you must create a .env file with the following variables:
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_DATABASE=nba-data
```

After that, just configure what seasons do you want to gather data from on the main.py file, and run the program.
